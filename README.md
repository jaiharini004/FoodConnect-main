# FoodConnect

FoodConnect is a web-based food donation and request platform designed to reduce food waste and help people in need by connecting donors, verified NGOs/trusts, and receivers in one simple digital experience.

The application allows people with extra food to donate it, helps receivers request food through verified organizations, and offers an admin dashboard to review and approve trust/NGO applications and food requests.

---

## Overview

FoodConnect focuses on a practical and social mission:

- Reduce food wastage by redirecting surplus food to those who need it
- Support local communities through direct food sharing
- Provide verification through trusted NGOs and charitable organizations
- Create a transparent tracking system for donation and delivery status
- Keep the system simple, lightweight, and easy to run locally

This project is built as a frontend-only demo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data stored in the browser using localStorage.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a lightweight frontend stack:

- HTML5 for structure and UI layout
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for logic, form handling, DOM updates, and local data processing
- localStorage for lightweight data persistence (users, requests, food data)
- IndexedDB for storing uploaded PDF documents (organizations)
- Python HTTP server for local project execution during development

## Project Architecture

The architecture is intentionally simple because the project is a frontend demo and not yet backed by a database or server API.

### Frontend Layer
- Public website pages render the donation and request experience
- Login and admin screens handle the role-based sections of the platform

### Client-Side Logic Layer
- JavaScript manages all major workflows such as:
  - donation submission
  - request handling
  - status updates
  - trust approvals
  - admin actions

### Data Layer
- Text and structured data are stored in browser localStorage under keys such as:
  - `foodConnectFoods`
  - `foodConnectTrusts`
  - `foodConnectRole`
- Uploaded organization documents (PDFs) are securely stored in the browser's IndexedDB.
- This hybrid storage approach makes the app easy to demo while handling files robustly.
